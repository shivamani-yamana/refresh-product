# Refresh Product Advertisement Page
"This is the mix of my skills in Front End Development and 3d animation.The reason why I did this product animation I did is to explore blender more deeply.I had fun creating this awesome product renders and b-roll show casing the product.

I have used HTML,CSS, JAVASCRIPT and some Javascript and jQuery Libraries to add more functionality and user experience to the page.
The libraries I used are GSAP Javascript Animation Library,Scroll trigger plugin,Locomotive Scroll,etc.
On the main screen or landing page,I used basic javascript and css to create that awesome 3d look.


Hope you enjoy this!
